## Stockholm

The week began in Mestia, Georgia. Then I visited Kutaisi for a day. From there I flew directly to Stockholm. Actually, not directly, I repacked my bags at the airport in Wrocław. Sleeping at the airport and in the morning picking up the keys at Stockholms studentbostäder. 

The apartment is almost completely empty. But there is not much time, because in an hour the introductory meeting at the KTH campus start. What an superb introduction! And students dancing and partying all over the campus. I love it here already! The very next day I attend the Welcome ceremony at Stockholm City Hall. The event has a motivational tone with speeches from the KTH president, a representative of the student union (THS) and alumni. All this interspersed with musical performances. For the rest of the week I am learning Swedish and getting to know city a bit.
