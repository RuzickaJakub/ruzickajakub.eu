The week started in the Czech Republic. I attended a graduation ceremony and then returned to Stockholm, where I returned to my already well-established routine. A nice change was the Velvet Run organized by the Czech Embassy in Stockholm. It was the fifth annual running celebration on 17 November. And as a pleasant surprise, it finally started to snow on Sunday evening. 

Slowly I continue in pwn.college. We're doing a lot of law school now. I spent most of Sunday honestly reading the Handbook on European Data Protection Law and it will take quite some time.
