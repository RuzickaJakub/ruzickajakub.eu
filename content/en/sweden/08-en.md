## Artificial Intelligence

During the week I worked mainly on AI tasks, which I neglected a bit during the flag catching. I managed to work on my Swedish and German by visiting Språkcafé on both Wednesday and Thursday. The chain on my bike broke during Sunday's trip, which resulted in me missing the scheduled museum tour, so hopefully next week.
