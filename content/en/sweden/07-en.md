## Ethical hacking completed

During Monday and Tuesday, I captured the remaining flags in the Ethical Hacking course, earning my first A at KTH. On Tuesday, I participated in a discussion about cyber attacks and what we can learn from them. Wednesday was dedicated to studying Swedish and in the evening I took part in a student visit to Combitech, where we were able to try out the role of the Incident Response Team. We were given a hard drive dump, logs and recorded network traffic and our goal was to solve a ransomware attack. And we did! It was WannaCry introduced on a flash disk by a disgruntled employee. I had never tried anything like this before, so it took me a while to get into it. Starting Thursday, I slowly started to move forward with the labs for the ANNDA - Artificial Intelligence and Deep Neural Networks course.

As part of my exploration of the local culture, I started watching the series Vår tid är nu and started attending Språkcafé, which takes place every Wednesday at the KTH library. On Sunday I attended mass at Gustaf Vasa Church and then relaxed and read at Hornsbergs strandpark, but it was incredibly windy so I moved to the terrace overlooking Stockholm City Hall.
