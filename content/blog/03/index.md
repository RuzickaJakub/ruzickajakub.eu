In the second week everything has already gained momentum and it is not surprising, since the first examinations start on 13 October. The academic year is divided into two semesters. But these are divided into periods, called P1, P2 in the winter term and P3, P4 in the summer term, and in each of these periods different subjects are taught and these end with exams. I embarked with enthusiasm on Ethical Hacking, where we have (via VPN) access to a network and our goal is to attack devices connected to the network. I was very enthusiastic about the course and spent a good part of the week with it. The other course I have is Artificial Intelligence and Deep Architectures. In this course we work in teams of three and mine aren't communicating much yet, so we'll see.

In addition to the study stuff, the bureaucratic game has started to run in the background of the regular days. I got my Swedish Personal Identity Number and thought I had won. But no, the next step is to get a National ID card, and then to get a Bank ID. The Bank ID is necessary, for example, to create an account at sl.se (Stockholm City Transport) or at blocket.se (online marketplace). Since I am a citizen of the Czech Republic, there is a second part to the bureaucratic game, and that is obtaining a certificate with the scary name: Assessment of studies at foreign universities for health, social security, pension and tax purposes. I already have the completed form and the certificate from the school, I just need to deliver the originals to Mal√° Strana in Prague.

Unfortunately, I forgot to take pictures this week. But I'll hopefully fix that next week.
