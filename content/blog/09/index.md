School exams have started. This period I have only one exam and one project presentation, so I decided to continue developing my hacking skills at pwn.college. At the same time, I have started to take more advantage of the opportunities that Stockholm offers. I started to regularly toughen up in the sea, had dinner on the seafront near Sergels Torg and Dramaten and visited the Museum of Medieval Stockholm. The weather was surprisingly beautiful, almost summer-like, on Monday and snowed on Thursday. Beautiful variety!
