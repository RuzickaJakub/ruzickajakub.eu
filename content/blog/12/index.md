The second period of the winter semester is slowly getting underway, but it's surprisingly slow considering the fact that everything is supposed to be done in 6 weeks. At least I've had plenty of time to take long walks and think about what's happened lately. On Friday I left by train for Copenhagen and from there (unfortunately without visiting the city) I flew to Prague to attend the celebration of 100 years of PONY.
