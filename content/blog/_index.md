Hey! 👋 Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Jakub Růžička. I maintain this website and study Cybersecurity at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. I enjoy running, climbing, playing CTF as a member of the [RoyalRoppers](https://royalroppers.team/) and take on new challenges. Even though I'm now in Sweden, I lead a [Cefeus Nymburk](https://cefeus.skauting.cz/) scout troup .
