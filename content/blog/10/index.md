Stockholm offers an incredible number of parks. And it is these parks, combined with the colours of autumn and the pleasantly cool weather, that create the ideal conditions for running. Yes, you've rightly guessed I've really enjoyed being outdoors for the last week. Twice a day to swim in the sea, go for a run or a bike ride. Apart from presenting the project and finishing the last assignment for Artificial Intelligence, this week was less time consuming in terms of school. I continued with pwn.college on my own, but time was surprisingly plentiful this week.
