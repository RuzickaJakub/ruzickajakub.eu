I got inspired by the Diogo to create a list with the current challenges. The reason for making it publicly available is to both encourange myself and also to share the successes, when I manage to finish some part of it.

The items from the impossible list are not allowed to be removed, they can only be added, therefore it is nice to think about each item before adding it.
