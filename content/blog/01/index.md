The week began in Mestia, Georgia. I visited Kutaisi for one day. From there I flew directly to Stockholm. Actually, not directly, I repacked my bags at the airport in Wroclaw, spent the night at the airport in Stockholm and picked up my accommodation keys in the morning.

The apartment was and is almost completely empty. But there is no time to waste, because an hour after stepping into the apartment, the introductory meeting on campus starts. An incredible introduction! The introductory lecture was really well done. There are random groups of students around campus in overalls according to their section, dancing or performing other artistic acts. The very next day I attend the welcome ceremony at Stockholm City Hall. The event has a motivational tone with speeches from the KTH president, a representative of the student union (THS) and alumni. All this interspersed with musical performances. For the rest of the week I'm learning Swedish and getting to know the city a bit.
