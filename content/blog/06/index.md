This week was quite monotonous, but that certainly doesn't mean boring, quite the opposite. I spent most of the week hacking systems (with permission of course) and I would even say I was pretty good at it. Over the weekend I focused on the cloud, specifically Google Cloud Platform. To fill the free time, I listened to a podcast [Shoot the Messenger: Espionage, Murder & Pegasus Spyware](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/shoot-the-messenger-espionage-murder-pegasus-spyware/id1661177850) about the most famous spyware and especially its effects on society.

Over the weekend I boarded a Swedish double decker and headed to the island of Vaxholm, which is part of the Stockholm Archipelago. The weather was good and I walked almost around the island. I used the boat to take me back to the centre of Stockholm.
