I was already familiar with most of the buildings at KTH, and the centre of Stockholm was already a familiar place for me, so I decided to start exploring new places. I have been to the Stockholm City Library twice to study. And on Tuesday visited the Royal Opera House - Operan - for the ballet performance of Le corsaire. From my point of view, it was a very action-packed ballet with dynamic music. Two packages arrived at the same time: one from home and one from Stříbrná Řeka team. I didn't see the sun once during the week, but it rained five days a week. And I have to admit that the weather, along with certain events, can encourage a melancholy mood.

On Saturday and Sunday I participated together with RoyalRopper LakeCTF. We didn't make it to the final in Switzerland, but I learned a lot of new things, especially about vim.
